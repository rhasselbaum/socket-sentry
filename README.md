# Pardon our dust

__This project has been dormant for a while, but changes are coming! We're making a new home on GitHub, so please bear with me as I clean up wiki. But that's not all! A Plasma 5 port is in the works so watch this space.__

# Overview

Socket Sentry is a KDE Plasma widget that displays real-time traffic information for active network connections on your Linux computer. It shows you which processes are communicating with which hosts, current data transfer rates, protocols, and more. You can view all connections or see summary traffic by host pair and process or program. It supports IPv4 and 6, optional host name lookups with configurable subdomain depth, and many sorting and filtering options including pcap filter expressions.
