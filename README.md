# Watch this space

__This project has been dormant for a while, but changes are coming! We're making a new home on GitHub so please bear with me as I clean up the wiki. Plus, an update to Plasma 5 is in the works. Stay tuned for more news.__

# Overview

Socket Sentry is a KDE Plasma 4 widget that displays real-time traffic information for active network connections on your Linux computer. It shows you which processes are communicating with which hosts, current data transfer rates, protocols, and more. You can view all connections or see summary traffic by host pair and process or program. It supports IPv4 and 6, optional host name lookups with configurable subdomain depth, and many sorting and filtering options including pcap filter expressions.

# Installation

See the INSTALL file for details on how to build and install the software. The binary distro packages have been discontinued temporarily while we work on Plasma 5 support.
