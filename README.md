# The end

__This project is obsolete. Unfortunately, I don't have the time or motivation to migrate it to newer Plasma/Qt versions. I'll keep the repo up in case anyone extracts value from it. Thanks to all those who offered encouragement!__

# Overview

Socket Sentry is a KDE Plasma 4 widget that displays real-time traffic information for active network connections on your Linux computer. It shows you which processes are communicating with which hosts, current data transfer rates, protocols, and more. You can view all connections or see summary traffic by host pair and process or program. It supports IPv4 and 6, optional host name lookups with configurable subdomain depth, and many sorting and filtering options including pcap filter expressions.

# Installation

See the INSTALL file for details on how to build and install the software. The binary distro packages have been discontinued temporarily while we work on Plasma 5 support.
